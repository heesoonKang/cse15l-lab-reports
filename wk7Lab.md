## **find command-line options** ##


The command -empty searches for empty files and directories. This commands finds all empty folders and files in the entered directory or sub-directories. The above image is example of when trying -empty function in the technical directory where shows there is no empty file 




The above image is example of trying -empty when there exists a empty function. I have created one as a example: 



The above example is when there exits multiple empty files within the /technical. They were created in 911report and biomed files. This empty file would be helpful in real life because it's easy way to check if student "accidently" submitted empty file which can be happen when student forgets to save their code.
